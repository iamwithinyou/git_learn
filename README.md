Learning new way of git and git commands 
Copilot said: If you want to **clone a specific
If you want to clone a specific branch from a Git repository (instead of cloning all branches), you can do so using the following methods:

1. Clone the Repository and Checkout a Branch
By default, git clone clones the whole repository with all branches, and checks out the default branch (usually main or master).
After cloning, you can switch to any branch:

bash
git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
cd repo
git checkout branch-name
or (with newer Git):

bash
git switch branch-name
2. Clone Only a Specific Branch (Shallow Clone)
If you want to save time and space by cloning only a single branch (and not the full history), use:

bash
# git clone --branch branch-name --single-branch https://github.com/owner/repo.git
# --branch branch-name: Specifies which branch to checkout.
# --single-branch: Only pulls the history of that branch.
# This is useful for large repos or when you only need one branch.

3. Summary Table
Use Case	Command Example
Clone all branches	git clone https://github.com/owner/repo.git
Clone specific branch only	git clone --branch branch-name --single-branch https://github.com/owner/repo.git
Tip:
If youâ€™ve already cloned the repo and want to fetch another branch later:

bash
git fetch origin branch-name
git checkout branch-name
Let me know if you want detailed examples for a specific repo or scenario!
